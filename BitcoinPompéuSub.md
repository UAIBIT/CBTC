Notes: Pompéu, originally known as Buriti da Estrada, began as a settlement around the Pompéu Farm in the 18th century. Rich in history and surrounded by nature, the city offers beautiful waterfalls, rivers, and hills. Key attractions include the Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (built in 1852), the Dona Joaquina Cultural Center, honoring one of Brazil’s most iconic 19th-century women, and the Pará River, a hotspot for fishing and a vital part of the São Francisco River basin.
